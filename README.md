# Project 1 - Catch Me If You Can!
Business Email Compromises (BECs) are responsible for many phishing scams, incurring billions of dollars of losses. In this simulated activity, I inspected `.pcap` files using Wireshark to determine which emails are fraudulent and which cars are legitimate.
***
## Goals
- Inspect `.pcap` files and extract their email content
- Identify legitimate vs fraudulent emails
- Correctly identify the bad actor

## Tools
- **Ubuntu VM (Microsoft Azure)**: safe environment to handle malicious email traffic
- **Wireshark**: packet sniffing tool used to inspect `.pcap` files
- **Mozilla Thunderbird**: Mozilla's email client which is compatible with Ubuntu Linux, used to read `.eml` files

## Process
## Key Findings
